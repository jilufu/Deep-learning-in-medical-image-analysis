# Deep Learning for Medical Imaging – Assignments Overview
## Introduction
This repository contains my assignments for the **Deep Learning for Medical Imaging** course. 
In this README, I will summarize the key learnings from each assignment and the objectives achieved.

## Assignment 1: Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Fully Connected Neural Networks

### **Objective**
- Analyze normalized handwritten digits from scanned envelopes by the U.S. Postal Service.
- Predict digit IDs (0-9) from **16×16 grayscale images**.

### **Key Learnings**
- Explored **neural network architectures** for image classification, specifically using **fully connected layers instead of CNNs**.
- Studied literature on similar handwritten digit datasets and applied **best practices in hyperparameter tuning**.
- Designed a **compact neural network** with two hidden layers, balancing efficiency and accuracy.
- Achieved **95% validation accuracy** and **94.4% test accuracy** while significantly reducing computational cost.
- Demonstrated that a well-optimized fully connected network can perform efficiently for small-scale image classification tasks, reducing **inference time, energy consumption, and training duration**.
